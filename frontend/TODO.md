## general stuff

- [x] i18n
- [ ] eslint
- [ ] prettier (seems to kinda work but I don't get ide hints? maybe that comes only with eslint?)
- [ ] header
- [ ] footer
- [ ] layout
- [ ] recheck env vars (env vars are now handled via runtime config stuff)
- [x] server stuff for hydra (move to spring?)
- [ ] figure out why it bork `Uncaught SyntaxError: The requested module '/_nuxt/types/helpers.d.ts' does not provide an export named 'Props' (at FormScript.vue:5:1)`
  - workaround seems to just not import it? lol
